# JpDeathBlade's Pokemon Emporium
Game saves for Pokemon Ultra Sun.

# Prep
- !! Back up your existing save file !!

# Install
- Place these folders into a save manager like Checkpoint.
- Restore the save file.

# Warnings
You should **NOT** bring these Pokemon forward into Pokemon Bank/Home as they will easily come up as duplicates with matching PIDs and Encryption Constants. If you do want to bring them forward, make sure you randomize these values. *I take no responcibility for your accounts if they were to get banned or for the data of your game cart.*
